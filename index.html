            Hi there! I'm Izibevie Gift Diezibe, a microbiologist transitioning into tech.
            My goal is to become a skilled front-end engineer and I'm really excited about this journey.
            Outside of tech, I love reading books and catching the latest movies.
            <br><br>
            I started following Alt School Africa last year on Instagram and kept looking forward to applying.
            I am a student and here's my school ID: ALT/SOE/024/0370.
            I joined Alt School because of its personalized learning, innovation in education, and its project-based learning.
